---------- STARTUP ----------
The startup is easy, you need to just follow instructions.

You need to just launch INSTALLATION.sh and then execute the python script.

**2nd method**
Open terminal then type the following command:
```pip install -r requirements.txt```

**For windows**
If you didn't install packages, that was used on that python script, then
launch command prompt then type the command that was in the 2nd method for linux.
